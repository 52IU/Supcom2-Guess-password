# Supcom2-Guess-password
Something I wrote out of boredom one day. Hope someone can find this useful or fun and maybe learn something.

Reads lines from "test.txt", you may change this by changing FileName := "YOURFILE".
Copies line to clipboard, pastes, then submits by pressing enter.

Hotkeys:
     F8: Start trying passwords
     F9: Stops the guessing
     F10: Ends the script
